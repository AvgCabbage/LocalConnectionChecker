# LocalConnectionChecker

PowerShell script I wrote to check for any connections on LAN by checking netstat.
Not completely sure why I wrote this, just something I found in my work-in-progress
folder. Still pretty rough, but seems functional in the event that you'd actually
want to use it.

I remember finding a blog post or something that really helped with the netstat
data formatting. Must not have bookmarked it, but will link it when I find it.
